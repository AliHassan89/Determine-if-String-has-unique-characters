# Determine-if-String-has-unique-characters

Question:
Is Unique: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique 
characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?
Answer:
If additional data structure cannot be used then simply sort the string and 
compare adjacent values. If they are same return false. It will take O(n Log n)
time.
